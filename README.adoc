= Terraform plugin for Gradle

I wrote this as I was not content with the existing https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] offerings for Gradle. These plugins have a strong focus on flexibility in order to meet a variety of project needs.

You need at least Gradle 6 to use this plugin.

Please see the https://ysb33rOrg.gitlab.io/terraform-gradle-plugin[plugin & API documentation].

restricted to gradle 8.6 otherwise:
```
