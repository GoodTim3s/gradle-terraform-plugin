The `terraform` project extension configures a method of obtaining a `terraform` executable. On <<platforms,supported platforms>> it offers the option of configuring a Terraform version, which Gradle will then download, cache and use. THe project extension also allows for the definition of variables at a global level.

Each Terraform task also has a `terraform` extension which can be used to override any settings from the project extension on a per-task basis.
